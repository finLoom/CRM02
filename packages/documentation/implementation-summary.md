It's actually a good practice to separate your core domain objects from module-specific implementations. This follows clean architecture principles:

Keep com.enterprise.core.* for domain entities, interfaces, and core services
Keep com.enterprise.modules.* for module-specific implementations

In this case, for UserService:

Create the folder structure:
Copybackend/src/main/java/com/enterprise/core/user/service/

Place UserService.java in that folder



You can modify your package.json to use an approach that works before dependencies are installed:
jsonCopy"scripts": {
    "reinstall": "node -e \"if(require('fs').existsSync('node_modules')) require('fs').rmSync('node_modules', {recursive:true})\" && npm install"
}
