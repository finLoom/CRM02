# Git Branching Strategy for Major Changes

When making significant changes to a codebase, using Git branches is considered a best practice. This document outlines the process, advantages, and alternatives to the branch-and-merge workflow.

## Creating a Branch and Merging Later

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature-name

# Make your changes, then commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# When ready to merge, switch back to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes from main (important!)
git pull origin main

# Merge your branch into main
git merge feature-name

# Push changes to remote repository
git push origin main

# Optionally, delete your branch when done
git branch -d feature-name
```

## Advantages of the Branch Approach

- **Isolation**: Develop new features without affecting the stable main branch
- **Organization**: Keep related changes grouped together logically
- **Safety**: Experiment freely without risking the stability of your production code
- **Collaboration**: Allow multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously
- **Code Review**: Make it easier for team members to review changes as a cohesive unit
- **Rollback Capability**: Abandon changes entirely if needed without complex reverts
- **Testing**: Test new features thoroughly before integrating them with the main codebase

## Alternative Approaches

### Pull Request Workflow
Better for team environments with formal code review processes:

```bash
# Create and checkout new branch
git checkout -b feature-name

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push branch to remote repository
git push -u origin feature-name
```

Then create a pull request in your Git platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) and wait for approval before merging.

### Git Stash Approach
For temporary changes or when you need to switch contexts quickly:

```bash
# Save changes without committing
git stash

# Do other work, switch branches, etc.

# Reapply your changes
git stash pop
```

### Feature Flags
For large projects where features need to be deployed but not immediately activated:

1. Implement changes behind conditional flags
2. Merge code into main while keeping features disabled
3. Enable features when ready via configuration

## Best Practices for Branch Management

1. Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/login-error`)
2. Keep branches short-lived when possible
3. Regularly sync with main to avoid complex merge conflicts
4. Delete branches after they've been merged
5. Consider using a branching strategy like GitFlow for larger projects

## When to Use Each Approach

- **Feature Branches**: For any non-trivial change to the codebase
- **Pull Requests**: When working in teams or open source projects
- **Git Stash**: For quick context switches or temporary work
- **Feature Flags**: For large features that require gradual rollout

The branch approach is generally the most versatile and safest option for major changes.
