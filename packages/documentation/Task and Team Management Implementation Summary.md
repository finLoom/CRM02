# Task and Team Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've implemented a comprehensive task and team management system that can be integrated with your CRM and other enterprise modules. The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns and reusable components.

## Backend Implementation

### Core Entities
1. **Task Entity** (`backend/src/main/java/com/enterprise/core/task/entity/Task.java`)
   - Represents a task with attributes like title, description, status, priority, etc.
   - Supports hierarchical relationships (parent-child tasks)
   - Links to related objects (contacts, opportunities, etc.)
   - Tracks completion percentage and time estimates

2. **Team Entity** (`backend/src/main/java/com/enterprise/core/team/entity/Team.java`)
   - Represents an operations team with members and manager
   - Supports different team types and functional areas
   - Manages team membership

### Repositories
1. **Task Repository** (`TaskRepository.java`)
   - Provides data access methods for tasks
   - Supports filtering by status, assignee, team, module, etc.
   - Handles overdue and upcoming tasks

2. **Team Repository** (`TeamRepository.java`)
   - Provides data access methods for teams
   - Supports filtering by type, department, functional area, etc.

### Service Layer
1. **Task Service** (`TaskService.java` / `TaskServiceImpl.java`)
   - Business logic for task management
   - CRUD operations for tasks
   - Task assignment and status management
   - Task relationships management

2. **Team Service** (`TeamService.java`)
   - Business logic for team management
   - CRUD operations for teams
   - Team membership management

### REST Controllers
1. **Task Controller** (`TaskController.java`)
   - RESTful endpoints for task management
   - Handling of task-related HTTP requests

2. **Team Controller** (`TeamController.java`)
   - RESTful endpoints for team management
   - Handling of team-related HTTP requests

## Frontend Implementation

### Services
1. **Task Service** (`TaskService.js`)
   - API client for task endpoints
   - Methods for task operations

2. **Team Service** (`TeamService.js`)
   - API client for team endpoints
   - Methods for team operations

3. **User Service** (`UserService.js`)
   - API client for user endpoints
   - Methods for user operations

### Components
1. **Task List** (`TaskList.jsx`)
   - Displays a list of tasks with filtering and search
   - Supports different views (all, my tasks, overdue, etc.)
   - Includes pagination and sorting

2. **Task Detail** (`TaskDetail.jsx`)
   - Detailed view of a task
   - Shows task information, subtasks, and related objects
   - Actions for updating task status and properties

3. **Task Form** (`TaskForm.jsx`)
   - Form for creating and editing tasks
   - Validation and submission handling
   - Support for parent-child relationships

4. **Teams List** (`TeamsList.jsx`)
   - Displays a list of teams with filtering and search
   - Team management actions

5. **Task Tree View** (`TaskTreeView.jsx`)
   - Monday.com style hierarchical view of tasks
   - Expandable/collapsible task hierarchy
   - Visual indicators for task status and progress

### Pages
1. **Tasks Page** (`TasksPage.jsx`)
   - Main page for task management
   - Tab navigation for different task views
   - Search and filtering capabilities

## Key Features

### Task Management
- Hierarchical task structure (parent-child relationships)
- Cross-module task visibility (CRM, HR, Accounting, etc.)
- Task assignment to users and teams
- Status tracking and progress monitoring
- Due date management and overdue detection
- Task categorization by module and priority

### Team Management
- Operations team creation and management
- Team member assignment
- Team categorization by type and department
- Active/inactive team status

### Integration Points
- Tasks can be linked to any object type (contacts, opportunities, etc.)
- Cross-module visibility of tasks and teams
- Consistent UI patterns across modules

## Next Steps

### Additional Components to Implement:
1. **Team Detail** - Detailed view of a team with member management
2. **Team Form** - Form for creating and editing teams
3. **Dashboard** - Summary view of tasks and team performance
4. **Task Kanban Board** - Kanban view of tasks by status
5. **Task Timeline** - Gantt chart view of tasks

### Integration with Other Modules:
1. **CRM Integration** - Link tasks to contacts, opportunities, etc.
2. **HR Integration** - Link tasks to employees, departments, etc.
3. **Accounting Integration** - Link tasks to invoices, expenses, etc.

### Additional Features:
1. **Task Templates** - Predefined task templates for common workflows
2. **Recurring Tasks** - Support for recurring task schedules
3. **Time Tracking** - Detailed time tracking for tasks
4. **Notifications** - Email and in-app notifications for task assignments and due dates
5. **Reporting** - Advanced reporting on task and team performance
